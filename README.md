# Learning Python Exercises

This is my work on the examples in the learning python book. This may
have no interest to you or it may be helpful if you are getting stuck
on one of the exercises.  The version of the book these examples are
from is the second edition.  Here is a [link to the book on
Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Second-Mark-Lutz/dp/0596002815).
It should be noted that I am not the author (Mark Lutz) nor do I have
any association with him other than having read and enjoyed his book.

If you see any errors, improvements, or anything else feel free to
drop me a line.
